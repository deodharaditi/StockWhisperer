## Uniqueness and Model Overview üåü

The StockWhisperer App distinguishes itself by adopting a unique approach to stock price prediction, focusing on fundamental financial factors rather than traditional technical indicators. Here's an overview of what sets our app apart:

### Unique Features:

1. **Fundamental Financial Factors**: Our app's predictive model is trained on a dataset prepared using the QuickFS API, which provides comprehensive financial data for publicly traded companies. Instead of relying solely on technical indicators, such as moving averages or relative strength index (RSI), our model considers fundamental factors like revenue, earnings, profit margin, debt-to-equity ratio, and cash flow.

2. **Predictive Insights**: By analyzing fundamental financial data, our app aims to provide predictive insights into stock price movements over the next quarter. This approach allows investors to make informed decisions based on the underlying health and performance of the companies they are interested in.

3. **Long-Term Investment Perspective**: While technical indicators are often used for short-term trading strategies, our app caters to investors with a long-term investment perspective. By focusing on fundamental factors, it provides insights that are relevant for long-term portfolio management and strategic investment decisions.

### Dataset Preparation Process:

1. **QuickFS API**: We leverage the QuickFS API to access a wealth of financial data for publicly traded companies. This API allows us to retrieve key financial metrics, balance sheet information, income statements, and cash flow statements for comprehensive analysis.

2. **Data Cleaning and Preparation**: The retrieved financial data is cleaned, processed, and prepared for training our predictive model. This involves handling missing values, normalizing data, and selecting relevant features that are indicative of a company's financial health.

3. **Model Training**: Using the prepared dataset, we train a deep learning-based model that learns patterns and relationships between fundamental financial factors and stock price movements. This trained model forms the backbone of our StockWhisperer App.

### Benefits:

- **Holistic Analysis**: By considering fundamental financial factors, our app provides a more holistic analysis of stock market trends and dynamics.
- **Investment Insights**: Investors can gain valuable insights into the underlying health and performance of companies, enabling them to make more informed investment decisions.
- **Diversification Opportunities**: Our app encourages diversification by highlighting stocks with strong fundamental indicators, potentially reducing investment risk.
